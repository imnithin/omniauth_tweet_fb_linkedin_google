Complete replication from {rails-4-omniauth-using-devise-with-twitter-facebook-and-linkedin}[http://sourcey.com/rails-4-omniauth-using-devise-with-twitter-facebook-and-linkedin/]

Works good for {fb}[www.facebook.com] and {twitter}[www.twitter.com]

For {LinkedIn}[linkedin.com] email and name isn't getting stored, even though API call is returning the part.

Twitter doesn't return <tt>email</tt>, so another step is being added in the app.

== Generate App ID and App Secret token

{developers.facebook.com}[https://developers.facebook.com/]
 Settings link - Advanced Tab: Valid OAuth redirect URIs: http://127.0.0.1:3000/
 
{apps.twitter.com/}[https://apps.twitter.com/]

 Website URL:http://127.0.0.1:3000/
 OAuth 2.0 Redirect URLs: http://127.0.0.1:3000/

 Website URL:http://127.0.0.1:3000/
 
 OAuth 2.0 Redirect URLs: http://127.0.0.1:3000/users/auth/google_oauth2/callback
